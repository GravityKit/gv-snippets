# What does this plugin do?

Removes Edit Entry "nonce" validation. Edit Entry checks whether an user has the ability to edit an entry, but it also checks a "nonce" to make sure that the Edit Entry link was recently generated by the current user visiting the page. This can sometimes cause problems; this plugin removes that "nonce" validation.
